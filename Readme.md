# 📩 SMS Spam Classifier (Naive Bayes Learning Project)

## Description
This project is a **learning-based Machine Learning project** created to understand the working of the **Naive Bayes algorithm**.

The system classifies SMS messages into **Spam** and **Not Spam (Ham)** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier.

The main goal of this project is to learn how Naive Bayes works in text classification problems.
